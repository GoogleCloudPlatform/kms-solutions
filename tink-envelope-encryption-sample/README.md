# Envelope encryption with Tink

## Overview

This guide provide an [envelope encryption](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption) sample using [Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink) with Terraform.


## Context

This automation has 2 terraform modules: [0-encrypt](./0-encrypt/) and [1-decrypt](./1-decrypt/).

**0-encrypt** module is responsible to provide all the required infrastructure (locally and in GCP) in order to encrypt data using a tink encrypted [keyset](https://developers.google.com/tink/design/keysets).

**1-decrypt** module is responsible to provide all the required infrastructure (locally only) in order to decrypt data using a tink encrypted [keyset](https://developers.google.com/tink/design/keysets). This module requires inputs generated by `0-encrypt`module outputs.
