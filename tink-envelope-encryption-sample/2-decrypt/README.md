# [2-decrypt module] Envelope encryption with Tink

## Overview

This module decrypts a file previously encrypted with envelope encryption using Tink and Terraform.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads);
- [Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk);
    - You must be authenticated in your GCP account. If you're not you should run `gcloud auth login`;
- An existing Tink encrypted [keyset](https://developers.google.com/tink/design/keysets) file;
    - And an existing file encrypted with this keyset;
- [Go 1.22+](https://go.dev/dl/);

## Deploy infrastructure

1. Rename `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars`:
    ```sh
    mv terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
    ```

1. Update `terraform.tfvars` file with the required values.

1. Create the infrastructure.

    ```sh
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

1. The desired file is now re-encrypted.
